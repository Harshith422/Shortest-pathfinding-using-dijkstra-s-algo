Here’s a `README.md` file for your **Dijkstra's Algorithm Shortest Path Finder** project, which includes both the **C implementation** and the **web-based visualization** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm - Shortest Path Finder  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for finding the shortest path in a graph. It consists of:  
- A **C program** that takes a graph input and computes the shortest path.  
- A **Web-based visualization** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, allowing users to interactively enter graph data and see the shortest path.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **C Implementation** – Reads a graph, processes shortest paths, and displays results.  
✅ **Interactive Web Interface** – Allows users to visualize the shortest path computation.  
✅ **User Input Support** – Accepts custom graphs through prompt-based input.  
✅ **Dynamic Path Highlighting** – Displays calculated shortest paths in the browser.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage  

### 1️⃣ Running the C Program  
#### **Requirements**  
- **C Compiler (GCC or Clang)**  

#### **Compilation & Execution**  
```sh
gcc code.c -o dijkstra
./dijkstra
```
- Enter the number of nodes.  
- Provide the cost matrix values.  
- Specify the source node.  
- The program will output the shortest paths and their costs.  

### 2️⃣ Running the Web Visualization  
#### **Requirements**  
- Any modern web browser (**Chrome, Firefox, Edge**)  

#### **Steps**  
1. Open `pathfinding.html` in a browser.  
2. Click the **"Run Algorithm"** button.  
3. Enter the number of nodes and costs.  
4. See the shortest paths dynamically updated in the UI.  

## 🔍 How Dijkstra’s Algorithm Works  
1. **Initialize:** Set the starting node distance to `0` and others to `infinity`.  
2. **Visit Unvisited Nodes:** Choose the node with the smallest tentative distance.  
3. **Update Distances:** For each neighbor, update its shortest distance if a shorter path is found.  
4. **Repeat Until All Nodes Are Visited.**  

## 📄 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Add **Graphical UI** for the C implementation.  
🔹 Improve **animation effects** in the web visualization.  
🔹 Allow users to **upload graph files** instead of manual input.
